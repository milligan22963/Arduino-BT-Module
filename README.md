Arduino-BT-Module
=================

Code to interface with the Seeed studio Bluetooth shield.  Example shows usage as "Master" device as a simple SPP passthrough over Bluetooth.

Should have been named Arduino-BT-Module however I typed too fast.  Sigh.  Had already linked to it when I realized my mistake.
